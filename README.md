# CIFAR-10 Image Classification with CNN

## Overview
This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset, which contains 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, such as airplane, automobile, bird, cat, etc.

## Dataset
CIFAR-10 dataset from Keras:

```python
from tensorflow.keras.datasets import cifar10
(X_train, y_train), (X_test, y_test) = cifar10.load_data()
Classes: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, truck.

Model Architecture

Conv2D + MaxPool2D layers: Extract spatial features from images.

Flatten layer: Converts feature maps to a 1D vector.

Dense layer (128 neurons, ReLU): Learns abstract features.

Dropout (0.5): Prevents overfitting.

Dense output layer (10 neurons, softmax): Produces class probabilities.

Training

Loss function: categorical_crossentropy

Optimizer: adam

Metrics: accuracy

Epochs: 20â€“50 (adjust as needed)

Batch size: 32 or 64

Example:

model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(X_train, y_train,
          validation_split=0.2,
          epochs=20,
          batch_size=32)
